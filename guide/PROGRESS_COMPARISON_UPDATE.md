# Progress Comparison Update

## Summary
Updated the dashboard to compare the **latest report with the previous report** instead of showing overall progress from the beginning. This provides more actionable insights into recent changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard.tsx - Enhanced Metrics Calculation

#### Before:
- Showed total weight lost from initial to current
- BMI displayed without comparison
- Progress was based on overall journey

#### After:
- **Weight Change**: Compares latest report with previous report
  - Shows exact kg change since last report
  - Displays "since last report" subtitle when comparing two reports
  - Falls back to "total lost" when only one report exists
  - Trend arrow: ↓ green (lost weight), ↑ red (gained weight)

- **BMI Change**: Compares latest report with previous report
  - Shows exact BMI change since last report
  - Displays "since last report" or "increased since last report"
  - Falls back to "current" when only one report exists
  - Trend arrow: ↓ green (decreased), ↑ red (increased)

- **Overall Progress**: Still tracks total progress towards goal
  - Calculates from initial weight to target weight
  - Shows percentage towards goal achievement

### 2. MetricsCard.tsx - Smart Trend Colors

Added `trendIsPositive` prop to handle different trend interpretations:

- **For Weight & BMI**: Down trend (↓) = Good (green), Up trend (↑) = Bad (red)
- **For Progress**: Up trend (↑) = Good (green), Down trend (↓) = Bad (red)

## User Experience

### With 1 Report:
```
Current Weight: 85.0 kg
↓ 0.0kg total lost
```

### With 2+ Reports:
```
Current Weight: 82.5 kg
↓ 2.5kg since last report    [Green - Good!]

BMI: 26.3
↓ 0.8 since last report      [Green - Good!]
```

### If Weight Increased:
```
Current Weight: 86.0 kg
↑ 1.0kg gained since last report    [Red - Alert!]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Variables:
```typescript
// Latest vs Previous
const latestReport = reports[0];
const previousReport = reports[1];

// Weight comparison
const weightChange = previousWeight - currentWeight;
const weightTrend = weightChange > 0 ? 'down' : 'up';

// BMI comparison
const bmiChange = previousBMI - currentBMI;
const bmiTrend = bmiChange > 0 ? 'down' : 'up';
```

### Conditional Display:
- Shows comparison values only when `reports.length > 1`
- Gracefully falls back to total progress when only one report exists
- Handles edge cases (no change, neutral trends)

## Benefits

1. **Actionable Insights**: Users can see immediate impact of their recent efforts
2. **Motivation**: Clear feedback on progress since last check-in
3. **Trend Awareness**: Visual indicators (colors, arrows) make changes obvious
4. **Flexibility**: Still maintains overall progress tracking alongside recent changes
